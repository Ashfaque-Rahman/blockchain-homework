# Blockchain: Proof of Authority

## Objective
By the end of this project, we will be able to set up a Testnet called sifuzcoin using `Puppeth` to generate Gensis block and `Geth` tool.

## Steps and Procedure
* Using [Go Ethereum](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/), we will install `Blockchain-Tools` and create our genesis block and node set up 
* using [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/), we will send test ether and verify the transaction in the block

## Execution
1. First, we need to go to the `Blockchain-Tools` folder and open git bash terminal. Creating accounts for two (or more) nodes for the network with a separate datadir for each using geth.
Using below code we will set up our first node.
`./geth --datadir node1 account new`
